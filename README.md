# Change of Evidence
This package provides functions to test for a change of Bayesian evidence over time which can be used to examine volatile effects. It includes the following sequential Bayesian testing methods:
* Bayesian Sequential t-Tests
* Bayesian Sequential Non-Parametric Tests (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test & Mann-Whitney U Test)
* Bayesian Sequential Binomial Test
* Bayesian Sequential Correlation Test

Unusual temporal patterns of evidence accumulation can be tested against an empirical null distribution set via creating simulated data sets.
