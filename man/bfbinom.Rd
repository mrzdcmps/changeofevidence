\title{Bayesian Sequential Binomial Test}
\usage{
bfbinom(
  data,
  p = 0.5,
  prior.r = 0.1,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),
  nstart = 5,
  exact = TRUE,
  nullInterval = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A vector containing binary data (0s and 1s)}

\item{p}{Probability of success under the null hypothesis (default: 0.5)}

\item{prior.r}{Scale parameter for the prior distribution (default: 0.1)}

\item{alternative}{Direction of alternative hypothesis: "two.sided", "greater", or "less"}

\item{nstart}{Minimum number of data points before first BF calculation (>= 2)}

\item{exact}{Logical. If TRUE, calculates BF for all points; if FALSE, uses steps for efficiency}

\item{nullInterval}{Optional vector of length 2 for interval hypothesis testing (deprecated)}
}
\value{
A list of class "seqbf" containing:
  \itemize{
    \item probability of success: estimated probability
    \item p-value: from classical binomial test
    \item BF: vector of sequential Bayes Factors
    \item test type: "binomial"
    \item prior: list with prior distribution details
    \item sample size: total number of observations
    \item alternative: chosen alternative hypothesis
    \item data: list with element \code{x} (the cleaned binary data vector)
  }
}
\description{
Calculates Bayes Factors sequentially for dichotomous data, showing evidence evolution over time.
Uses 'proportionBF' from the BayesFactor package to compute Bayes Factors starting from a minimum
number of observations and updating with each new data point.

\examples{
data <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.7)
result <- bfbinom(data)
