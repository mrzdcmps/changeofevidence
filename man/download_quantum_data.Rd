\title{Download Pregenerated Quantum Random Data}
\usage{
download_quantum_data(path = NULL, force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Directory to save the file (default: package extdata directory)}

\item{force}{Re-download even if file exists (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
Path to downloaded file (invisibly)
}
\description{
Downloads pregenerated quantum random bits from GitHub releases for use with method="files".
The file contains 1,000 simulations worth of quantum random bits (1 million bits each).
After download, the path is automatically saved and used by simulation functions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Download once (file location is remembered automatically)
download_quantum_data()

# Then use in simulations (finds file automatically)
result <- bfbinom(rbinom(100, 1, 0.6))
sims <- simcreate(result, n.sims = 1000, method = "files")
}
}
