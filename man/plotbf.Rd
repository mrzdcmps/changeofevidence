\title{Plot Sequential Bayesian Analysis}
\usage{
plotbf(
  ...,
  labels = NULL,
  sims.df = NULL,
  sims.df.col = "bf",
  color = "black",
  coordy = NULL,
  label.x = "N",
  show_annotations = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more seqbf objects, vectors containing sequential Bayes Factors, or a single list containing multiple vectors.
When multiple seqbf objects or vectors are provided, they will be plotted together for comparison.}

\item{labels}{Optional character vector of names for multiple datasets. If NULL, auto-generates names.}

\item{sims.df}{A dataframe containing simulations, including column "simid". Set to NULL if you don't want to display simulations.}

\item{sims.df.col}{The name of the column of the simulation dataframe to compare to. Default is "bf".}

\item{color}{A color or vector of colors for the BF line(s). A single color is used for one line;
a vector of colors applies custom colors to multiple lines (overrides the default palette).}

\item{coordy}{A vector containing the minimum and maximum value of the y-coordinates to be drawn. If NULL, automatically determined.}

\item{label.x}{A character that overrides the label for the x-axis. Default is "N" (automatically set to "Trials" for binomial data).}

\item{show_annotations}{Logical. If TRUE (default), displays evidence strength annotations (e.g., "Moderate H1", "Strong H0"). Set to FALSE to hide annotations and use full plot width.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
This function allows to plot a sequential Bayesian analysis.
}
\details{
The BF analysis can be plotted by itself or in comparison to simulated data sets. GGplot2 is used to draw an image.
BFs above 1 indicate evidence towards H1, BFs below 1 indicate evidence towards H0.
Depending on the amount of simulations, drawing might take a while. It might be wise to chose a smaller simulation set for this purpose.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Single seqbf object
plot(seqbf)
plotbf(seqbf)

# Single BF vector
p.bf <- plotbf(tbl$bf)
p.bf

# Multiple seqbf objects with custom labels
plotbf(bf1, bf2, labels = c("Experiment 1", "Experiment 2"))

# Multiple seqbf objects with auto-generated labels
plotbf(bf1, bf2, bf3)

# List of BF vectors (backward compatible)
plotbf(list(test1 = bf1$BF, test2 = bf2$BF))

# With simulated data
plotbf(tbl$bf, sims.df = sims)

# With subset of simulations
sims1000 <- subset(sims, simid <= 1000)
plotbf(tbl$bf, sims.df = sims1000)

# Custom y-axis limits
plotbf(bf1, bf2, coordy = c(1/30, 30))
