\title{Change of Evidence Analysis}
\usage{
coe(data, sims.df)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A seqbf object or vector containing Bayes Factors.}

\item{sims.df}{A dataframe containing simulations, must include column "simid".}
}
\value{
A list containing results from maxbf, energybf, and ffttest analyses.
}
\description{
This function performs a comprehensive analysis of Bayesian evidence over time by 
combining Maximum BF, Energy BF, and FFT analyses.
}
\details{
The function validates that simulation data matches the experimental data length,
automatically adjusting simulations if they are longer than needed, and performs
all three core analyses: maximum BF evaluation, energy calculation, and frequency
analysis via FFT.
}
\examples{
result <- coe(seqbf, sims)
result <- coe(bf_vector, sims.df = newsims)
}
