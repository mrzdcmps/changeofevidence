\title{Frequency Analysis}
\usage{
ffttest(data, sims.df = sims, sims.df.col = "density.bf")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A vector containing Fourier transformed (spectral density) data.}

\item{sims.df}{A dataframe containing simulations, including columns "index" and "simid".}

\item{sims.df.col}{The column of the simulation dataframe that contains the comparison data.}
}
\value{
A list containing the number and proportion of Top5 Frequencies as well as a list containing the names of these frequencies.
}
\description{
This function analyses FFTs and compares the amplitudes of all frequencies to those of simulations.
}
\details{
For each Frequency this function counts how many simulations show a higher amplitude.
If no more than 5% of simulations are above the experimental value, it is added to the "Top5"-list.
The proportion of Top5-Frequencies indicates the pronouncedness of oscillatory elements in the data.

\examples{
r.fftbf <- ffttest(tblFFT$density.bf)
r.fftrw <- ffttest(tblFFT$density.rw, sims.df = newsims, sims.df.col = "density.rw")
