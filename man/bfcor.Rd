\title{Bayesian Sequential Correlation Test}
\usage{
bfcor(
  x,
  y,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less"),
  prior.r = 0.1,
  nstart = 5,
  exact = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector containing continuous data}

\item{y}{A vector containing continuous data}

\item{alternative}{Direction of alternative hypothesis: "two.sided", "greater", or "less"}

\item{prior.r}{Scale parameter for the prior distribution (default: 0.1)}

\item{nstart}{Minimum number of data points before first BF calculation (>= 2)}

\item{exact}{Logical. If TRUE, calculates BF for all points; if FALSE, uses steps for efficiency}
}
\value{
A list of class "seqbf" containing:
  \itemize{
    \item r: Pearson correlation coefficient
    \item p-value: from classical correlation test
    \item BF: vector of sequential Bayes Factors
    \item test type: "correlation"
    \item prior: list with prior distribution details
    \item sample size: total number of observations
    \item alternative: chosen alternative hypothesis
  }
}
\description{
Calculates sequential Bayes Factors for correlation between two continuous variables,
showing how evidence evolves as data accumulates. Uses 'correlationBF' from the
BayesFactor package.
}
\examples{
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100, 0, 0.5)  # Correlated data
result <- bfcor(x, y, alternative = "greater")
}
